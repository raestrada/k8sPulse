# k8sPulse Documentation

## Overview

k8sPulse is an open-source Kubernetes monitoring tool designed for emergency scenarios when you only have `kubectl` access. It leverages the Python Kubernetes native client and OpenAI to provide intelligent recommendations on cluster health.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

To use k8sPulse, you'll need `pipx` installed to easily manage the tool as an isolated package.

### Installing k8sPulse with pipx

To install **k8sPulse** using `pipx`, run the following command:

```sh
pipx install git+https://github.com/raestrada/k8sPulse.git@v0.6.0
```

This command installs the latest tagged version (`v0.6.0`) of k8sPulse.

### Installing pipx

#### On Linux and macOS

To install `pipx` on Linux or macOS, run:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Ensure `python3` and `pip` are installed on your system.

#### On Windows

To install `pipx` on Windows, you can use the following command in PowerShell:

```sh
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
```

After installing `pipx`, close and reopen your terminal or run `refreshenv` if you're using the Windows Command Prompt.

## Usage

Once k8sPulse is installed, you can use the following commands and options to generate reports and monitor your Kubernetes cluster:

### Generating a Report

To generate a report with default settings, use:

```sh
k8spulse
```

This command will generate a Kubernetes cluster report for the default `staging` environment.

### Available Options

- `--env-name`
  - **Description:** Specify the environment name for the report.
  - **Default Value:** `staging`
  - **Usage:**
  
    ```sh
    k8spulse --env-name production
    ```

- `--interval`
  - **Description:** Set the interval (in seconds) between report generations.
  - **Default Value:** `300` (5 minutes)
  - **Usage:**
  
    ```sh
    k8spulse --interval 600
    ```

- `--use-ai`
  - **Description:** Use OpenAI to generate recommendations based on the report.
  - **Usage:**
  
    ```sh
    k8spulse --use-ai
    ```

- `--git-commit`
  - **Description:** Automatically commit and push the generated report to the Git repository.
  - **Usage:**
  
    ```sh
    k8spulse --git-commit
    ```

- `--gpt-model`
  - **Description:** Specify which GPT model to use for recommendations.
  - **Default Value:** `gpt-4o`
  - **Usage:**
  
    ```sh
    k8spulse --gpt-model gpt-4o
    ```

- `--zombies`  
  **Description**: Enable **experimental** zombie process detection in non-running pods using a Bash script and `kubectl`. This approach provides better performance compared to using the Python Kubernetes API client.  
  **Usage**:
  
  ```sh
  k8spulse --zombies
  ```
### Configuring Cast.AI Events Tracking

To enable tracking of Cast.AI events in your k8sPulse reports:

1. Ensure you have a [CAST AI API key](https://console.cast.ai/) set as an environment variable:
   
   ```sh
   export CAST_AI_API_KEY=your_cast_ai_api_key_here
   ```

2. Set the cluster ID you want to track by exporting it as an environment variable:
   
   ```sh
   export CAST_AI_CLUSTER_ID=your_cluster_id_here
   ```

3. The Cast.AI events will be automatically included in your k8sPulse report, providing details about node additions, deletions, and autoscaler actions.

## Example

Below is an example of using multiple options together:

```sh
k8spulse --env-name production --interval 600 --use-ai --git-commit --gpt-model got-4o
```

This command generates a report for the `production` environment every 10 minutes, uses OpenAI for recommendations, commits the report to Git, and uses the `got-4o` GPT model.

## Generating the HTML Report

After generating a report, you can view it by opening the generated `staging_statistics.html` file in your browser. The report provides a visual overview of the Kubernetes cluster, including gauges, unusual events, and detailed insights.
